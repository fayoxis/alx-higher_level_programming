different ways to use 3-say_my_name.py
============================================

This is an example of how to use the 3-say_my_name.py library.

The library contains a single function called say_my_name().

To import the say_my_name() function, use the following code:

Importing the function say_my_name.
    >>> say_my_name = __import__('3-say_my_name').say_my_name

Here are some examples of how to use the function correctly:

Example 1: Passing both the first name and the last name

    >>> say_my_name("Wendy", "Munyasi")
    My name is Wendy Munyasi

    >> say_my_name("Breezy")
    My name is Breezy

Passing last_name as None.
    >>> say_my_name("Wendy", None)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: last_name must be a string

Passing first_name and last_name as None.
    >>> say_my_name(None, None)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: first_name must be a string

Passing first name as None.
    >>> say_my_name(None, "Breezy")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: first_name must be a string

Passing wrong types as first_name and last_name
    >>> say_my_name(1, "Breezy")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: first_name must be a string

    >>> say_my_name("Chris", [4])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: last_name must be a string

Passing more than two arguments to say_my_name().
    >>> say_my_name("Chris", "Breezy", "Brown") #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: say_my_name() takes from 1 to 2 positional arguments but ...
