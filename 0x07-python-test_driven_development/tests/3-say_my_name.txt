============================================

This is an example of how to use the 3-say_my_name.py library.

The library contains a single function called say_my_name().

To import the say_my_name() function, use the following code:
``say_my_name()`` prints a person's first name and last name.

Importing the function say_my_name.
    >>> say_my_name = __import__('3-say_my_name').say_my_name

Here are some examples of how to use the function correctly:

Example 1: Passing both the first name and the last name.

    >>> say_my_name("Wendy", "Munyasi")
    My name is Wendy Munyasi

    >> say_my_name("Breezy")
    My name is Breezy

Example 2: Passing only the first name
    >>> say_my_name("Wendy", None)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: last_name must be a string

Please note that there are some error cases that you should be aware of:

        ...
    TypeError: first_name must be a string

Error 3: Passing None as the first name:

    >>> say_my_name(1, "Breezy")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: first_name must be a string
Error 4: Passing incorrect types for the first name and the last name:

    >>> say_my_name("Chris", [4])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...

        ...
    TypeError: say_my_name() takes from 1 to 2 positional arguments but ...
