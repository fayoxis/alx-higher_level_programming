"this is the 4-print_square module"
======================

The 'print_square' module is a unit test that verifies the
printing of '#' in a row to create a square.

Example 1: usage:

>>> from 4-print_square import print_square
>>> print_square(4)
####
####
####
####

Example 2 : It also works with larger squares, such as a 10x10 square:

>>> print_square(10)
##########
##########
##########
##########
##########
##########
##########
##########
##########
##########

Example 3 : When the size is set to 0, it doesn't print anything:

>>> print_square(0)

It also works with a 1x1 square:

>>> print_square(1)
#

However, there are certain error cases that are handled by the module:

- TypeError is raised when None is passed as the size parameter:

>>> print_square(None)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "4-print_square.py", line 12, in print_square
    raise TypeError("size must be an integer")
TypeError: size must be an integer

- ValueError is raised when a negative number is passed as the size parameter:

>>> print_square(-10)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "4-print_square.py", line 16, in print_square
    raise ValueError("size must be >= 0")
ValueError: size must be >= 0

- TypeError is raised when a negative float is passed as the size parameter:

>>> print_square(-10.5)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "4-print_square.py", line 20, in print_square
    raise TypeError("size must be an integer")
TypeError: size must be an integer

- TypeError is raised when a string is passed as the size parameter:

>>> print_square("hello")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "4-print_square.py", line 24, in print_square
    raise TypeError("size must be an integer")
TypeError: size must be an integer

- TypeError is raised when no value is passed to the function:

>>> print_square()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: print_square() missing 1 required positional argument: 'size'
