##  Requirements

### Python Scripts
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
*   All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using python3 (version 3.8.5).
*   All your files should end with a new line.
*   The `main.py` files are used to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo.
*   The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
*   Your code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`).
*   All your files must be executable.
*   All your test files should be inside a folder `tests`.
*   All your test files should be text files (extension: `.txt`).
*   All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`.
*   The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
*   All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`).
*   All your classes should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`).
*   All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)`' and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`).
*   A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified).
*   You are not allowed to import any module unless stated otherwise.

How to convert a JSON string to a Python data structure.


* **0. Read file** - Write a function that reads a text file (`UTF8`) and prints it to stdout. - `0-read_file.py`.
* **1. Write to a file** - Write a function that writes a string to a text file (`UTF8`) and returns the number of characters written. - `1-write_file.py`.
* **2. Append to a file** - Write a function that appends a string at the end of a text file (`UTF8`) and returns the number of characters added. - `2-append_write.py`.
* **3. To JSON string** - Write a function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string). - `3-to_json_string.py`.
* **4. From JSON string to Object** - Write a function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string. - `4-from_json_string.py`.
* **5. Save Object to a file** - Write a function that writes an Object to a text file, using a JSON representation. - `5-save_to_json_file.py`.
* **6. Create object from a JSON file** - Write a function that creates an Object from a “JSON file”. - `6-load_from_json_file.py`.
* **7. Load, add, save** - Write a script that adds all arguments to a Python list, and then save them to a file. - `7-add_item.py`.
* **8. Class to JSON** - Write a function that returns the dictionary description with simple data structure (list, dictionary, string, integer and boolean) for JSON serialization of an object. - `8-class_to_json.py`.
* **9. Student to JSON** - Write a class `Student` that defines a student by the given attributes. - `9-student.py`.
* **10. Student to JSON with filter** - Write a class `Student` that defines a student by the given attributes. (based on `9-student.py`). - `10-student.py`.
* **11. Student to disk and reload** - Write a class `Student` that defines a student by the given attributes. (based on `10-student.py`). - `11-student.py`.
* **12. Pascal's Triangle** - Create a function `def pascal_triangle(n):` that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal’s triangle of `n`. - `12-pascal_triangle.py`.
* **13. Search and update** - Write a function that inserts a line of text to a file, after each line containing a specific string. - `100-append_after.py`.
* **14. Log parsing** - Write a script that reads `stdin` line by line and computes metrics. - `101-stats.py`.
